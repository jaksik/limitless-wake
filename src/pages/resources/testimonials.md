    quote: "My son and I took wake surfing lessons for the first time with Chandler. Our boat club had recommended him and it was a great decision! He had me up surfing in no time with great spot corrections. Everything from getting up to how to get into the sweet spot in the wake and drop the rope. My son got in the water at age 10 and he got him up as well \U0001F44D\U0001F44F I couldn’t have been happier with the experience and how positive Chandler was in the whole process! I would recommend him to anyone \U0001F44C"
